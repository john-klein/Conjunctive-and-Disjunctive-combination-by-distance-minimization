# Conjunctive-and-Disjunctive-combination-by-distance-minimization

The repository contains two folders: one for Octave users another one for Matlab users.

Warning: Matlab users will be needing the optimization toolbox to run the scripts.

Each folder contains:
- a script for conjunctive combinations conjQP_multi.m
- a script for disjunctive combinations conjQP_multi.m
- a script for testing the functions test_me.m
